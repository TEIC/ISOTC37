# MAF Core (ISO 24611-1)

![validate_examples](https://github.com/TEIC/ISOTC37/workflows/validate_MAF_examples/badge.svg?event=push)

The documents in this repository present the ongoing work on the TEI serialization of MAF (Morphosyntactic Annotation Framework, [ISO 24611](https://www.iso.org/standard/51934.html)). So far, only MAF Core (part 1 of the MAF family) is represented here.

Please use issues to submit ideas, bug reports, etc. Contribution to the tools section and examples of implementations are very welcome.

Contents:

* MAF-1.odd is the TEI ODD file, from which both the documentation and the schemas are derived.
* MAF-1.html is the documentation of the ODD
* MAF-1.rng is the RELAX NG schema, used by the example document
* MAF-1_examples.xml is a test application of the ODD as well as a demo.
