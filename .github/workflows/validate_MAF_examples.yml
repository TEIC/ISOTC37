# This workflow validates the examples against the RNG schema
# this is probably more proof-of-conceptish than actually useful, since one would expect
# validation to happen even before a push. For the same reason, I don't want to dynamically
# create the RNG from ODD, simply because I also expect this to be done before a push 
# (or a pull request). But, who knows where we end up, so here's a piece of working functionality

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events, for the master branch and also for the test branch (which can be created to
# test some stuff, then deleted, and again.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
